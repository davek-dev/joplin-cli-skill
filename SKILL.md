# Joplin CLI Skill

Use `joplin` CLI to interact with Joplin notes.

## ⚠️ Important: Use CLI, Not SQL

**Always use the `joplin` CLI for editing notes.** Do not modify the SQLite database directly unless absolutely necessary. Direct database edits can cause sync conflicts and data loss.

If CLI import doesn't work as expected, sync and check the results in the Joplin GUI.

## Setup

If Joplin is not configured with WebDAV, configure it:

```bash
joplin config sync.target 6
joplin config sync.6.path "https://your-webdav-server/path"
joplin config sync.6.username "your-username"
joplin config sync.6.password "your-password"
joplin sync
```

## Common Commands

### List Notebooks and Notes
```bash
joplin ls                          # List notebooks
joplin ls "Notebook Name"          # List notes in a notebook
joplin status                      # Show sync status and note counts
```

### Read Note
```bash
joplin cat <note-id>               # Display note content
joplin note <note-id>              # Open note in editor
```

### Create Note
```bash
joplin mknote "Note Title"         # Create note in default notebook
joplin mknote "Note Title" --notebook "Notebook Name"
joplin mkbook "New Notebook"       # Create new notebook
```

### Edit Note
```bash
joplin edit --note <note-id>       # Edit note in editor
```

### Delete Note
```bash
joplin rmnote <note-id>            # Delete note
joplin rmbook "Notebook Name"      # Delete notebook
```

### Todos
```bash
joplin todos                       # List all todos
joplin todo <note-id>              # Toggle todo status
joplin done <note-id>              # Mark as done
joplin undone <note-id>            # Mark as not done
```

### Sync
```bash
joplin sync                        # Sync with WebDAV server
```

### Export
```bash
joplin export <note-id> --format md
joplin export <note-id> --format html
joplin export <note-id> --format pdf
```

### Search

Note: `joplin search` is only available in GUI mode. Use `joplin ls` and pipe to grep instead.

## Kanban Notes (YesYouKan Plugin)

Some notebooks use the YesYouKan kanban plugin for visual kanban boards. These notes have a specific format that **must be preserved** when editing:

### Kanban Format

```markdown
# Notebook Name

# Backlog

## Task 1

Description here

## Task 2



# In progress

## Another Task

Details



# Done

## Completed Task

Result

```kanban-settings
# Do not remove this block
```
```

### ⚠️ Kanban Formatting Rules

1. **Always include the kanban-settings block** at the end of the note with the exact format:
   ```
   ```kanban-settings
   # Do not remove this block
   ```
   ```

2. **Use `##` for task headings** (not `#`)

3. **Keep column headings** as `# Backlog`, `# In progress`, `# Done`

4. **Preserve blank lines** between tasks — these are visible in the kanban view

5. **After editing a kanban note, always run `joplin sync`** to upload changes

6. **Verify in Joplin GUI** after major edits to ensure formatting is correct

### Moving Tasks Between Columns

When moving a task, simply:
1. Remove the task from its current `##` heading section
2. Add it under the new column heading (`##` task name under `# Backlog`, `# In progress`, or `# Done`)

Example - moving "Doors Replacement Quote" from "In progress" to "Done":
```
# Done

## Doors Replacement Quote
